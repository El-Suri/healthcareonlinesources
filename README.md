This is repository for the WHAT project that aims to help users make sense in an online medical information jungle.

## Why?

According to the [Office National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/householdcharacteristics/homeinternetandsocialmediausage/bulletins/internetaccesshouseholdsandindividuals/2019) 54% of people in the UK are looking for health related information online. The figures vary worldwide, but in USA it might be even 80% according to [NBC](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3077086/t/more-people-search-health-online/).

Not all the medical information sources can be trusted.

We propose a web-browser plugin (Chrome so far) that warns you if the website, that you visit searching for healthcare related content, cannot be trusted.
